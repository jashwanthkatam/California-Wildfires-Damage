# 🔥 California Wildfires Damage Analysis

## 🌲 Project Overview

Wildfires have become an increasingly severe problem in California, causing devastating damage to forests, homes, wildlife, and communities.
This project analyzes historical wildfire data to uncover trends, identify key factors driving wildfire spread and damage, and provide insights that can help in prevention and preparedness efforts.

## 📌 Objectives

✅ Analyze historical wildfire data for California
✅ Identify patterns in fire frequency, size, and damage over time
✅ Visualize geographic areas most affected by wildfires
✅ Explore relationships between climate conditions and wildfire severity
✅ Suggest data-driven strategies for wildfire risk management
